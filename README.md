57 North Hacklab Ltd Articles Of Association
============================================

The git repository contains the Articles Of Association for 57 North Hacklab Ltd (https://www.57north.org.uk/).  They can be adjusted as a result of an AGM.

AGM minutes are kept in https://github.com/hackerdeen/meetings

If the articles are changed they need to be updated at Companies House, see https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/SC470230/filing-history

They are authored in Latex, from the file https://github.com/hackerdeen/articles/blob/master/hacklab_articles.tex which is then output as a PDF, see https://github.com/hackerdeen/articles/blob/master/hacklab_articles.pdf.  The PDF can be generated using the pdflatex utility, like `pdflatex hacklab_articles.tex`
